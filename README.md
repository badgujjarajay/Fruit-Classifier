# Fruit Classifier

Recognition of images is one of the most important components of the control systems, information processing systems and automated decision-making systems. Fruit classification is an important task in many industrial applications. A fruit classification system may be used to help a supermarket cashier identify the fruit species and prices. It may also be used to help people decide whether specific fruit species meet their dietary requirements. In this project, a fruit recognition system using CNN is proposed. The proposed method uses deep learning techniques for the classification of fruits. For model to train, I have created a dataset which contain 4,971 images from 10 different categories. Further more images are created after applying data augmentation techniques. The images are devided into training and testing datasets. A series of experiments were carried out using the proposed model on a dataset of 4,971 images of fruits of 10 different categories. The results of carrying out these experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach is capable of recognize the fruit name with an accuracy of 90%.
